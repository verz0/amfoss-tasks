## Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]
Pretty simple task but me being a newbie found it kinda difficult. I use windows 11 as my primary OS and decided to dual boot ubuntu but apparently I had to turn off my bitlocker which I hadn't. So my laptop got locked and I needed a 48 digit passcode and it took me so long just to unlock my laptop ðŸ˜­ but hey after 3 days I dual booted my laptop with ubuntu so yay ðŸ¥³
