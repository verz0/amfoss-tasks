## Folders containing server and client codes for task-05 :
the codes for server and client are in the .cs files in respective folders

I faced an error right at the starting of this task. It said "memory core dumped" or something similar to that. So i had to download an older version of .NET to make it work. After that error it was pretty much smooth sailing and I was able to solve the bugs and make the client and server run.
