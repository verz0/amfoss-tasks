# The files in the folder (in src) contain the different codes I wrote and used for this task

In my honest opinion, i found this task the toughest of all. I wrote 5 different codes for this task out of which 3 of them print out everything when I run it in the terminal. But none of the codes fully write the details to the csv files. They do when I write code for one of the required categories to write to a csv file but not all of them together. I couldnt find out how to solve the one error but I believe the codes which i have provided are 99% done. I'm uploading 3 different codes because i spent quiet a lot of time on this task and just wanted to show you seniors my efforts that I put into this task. sweat_smile
