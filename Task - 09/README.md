# The files in the folder (in src) contain the different codes I wrote and used for this task

In my honest opinion, i found this task the toughest of all. I wrote 5 different codes for this task out of which 3 of them print out everything when I run it in the terminal. But two of the codes dont write the details to fully to the csv files. They do when I write code for one of the required categories to write to a csv file but not all of them together. I couldnt find out how to solve the one error in the two codes. The working code is "**SCRAPER3.RS**".I'm uploading all the 3 codes because i spent quiet a lot of time on this task and just wanted to show you seniors my efforts that I put into this task. :sweat_smile:
