# Introspection
### Why must we choose you?
The idea of creating something on your own and having a command over it has always intrigued me. I am really passionate about technology and I want to develop softwares and apps for a good cause. Even though I dont have a cs background, I'm very positive that I can learn and write codes effectively. I feel like amFOSS would be an excellent platform for me to enhance my programming skills and help me learn about new tech related stuff. I have heard that there are really good mentors and developers in the club so I'd like to work with them and also participate in hackathons and various competitions. I'm an easy going guy and a team player so I think I would be a good addition to the club. I've heard a lot about this club (the hype for amfoss on quora is real) and I've tried my best with my current knowledge and given time to show my worth by doing these tasks.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
My plan for the next 6 months is to gain necessary skills to become a good competitive programmer. The idea of competitve programming is pretty cool and im kind of competitive too. Along with it I'd also like to go into one of the fields of development like open source, web or android. I have also looked up and learnt about GSOC, so now getting selected for it is also on my bucket list. I also plan on doing well in my exams and studies because I have been told it only gets harder from first year ðŸ˜… so I better get those scores up from the start.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will work to the extent of my knowledge and skills and do what the club wants me to and I will also try to represent amFOSS in various competitions. I will probably even get to mentor future ppl who get into the club.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The current selection process is pretty good. I have learnt so much about coding and programming in 1 month and not to mention that I started from square 0. The tasks gave me a taste of almost every aspect of development and coding.
