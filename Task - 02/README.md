# Terminal Hunt
## Here are the commands and the steps that I followed to complete this task :
1. I cloned the repository given in the doc using git clone
2. I moved into "TerminalHunt" using cd and made a new directory in it using "mkdir"
3. Then I moved into the directory using cd and made a txt file using the command "touch" and used the command "echo "abc" >> .txtfile" to write in the txt file
4. To commit i first added them using "git add . " and then used "git commit -a -m"
5. To switch to the new branch I used "git checkout" and to find the file i used " find . -name abc.txt "
6. I merged the branch using "git merge" and copied and changed the name of file using cp and mv
7. To concatenate i used the "cat" command and then deleted all the files except the file containing the passwords
