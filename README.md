## My views about the tasks
The tasks were fun and challenging to do. I learnt a lot through these tasks and now I'm just more intrigued to go deeper into the fields. I had to self learn the necessary things for the tasks in the process and I believe this skill would come handy in many situations. I used to start coding during those 10 minute breaks we get between each class because the errors I got in crypto and flutter were really annoying and I just wanted them out of my way. If i was not bombarded with lab exams and assignments during the last two weeks, I could have done all the optional tasks and given my best in the main tasks but hey, I tried my best.
## My introduction
Hi seniors ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pirajesh (the i is silent, saying this for the second time for more emphasis ðŸ’€) coming from Bangalore, Karnataka. I grew up in various cities in India but I'm originally from Madurai, TN. I was a PCMB student (Maths and biology) so I have no cs background. I got to know about amFOSS through quora while I was looking at reviews of the college and chose this campus out of Bangalore and Coimbatore ones for the coding culture here. To me amFOSS seems like the perfect place to meet people of like minded ideas and to scratch my head over errors and wrong codes
